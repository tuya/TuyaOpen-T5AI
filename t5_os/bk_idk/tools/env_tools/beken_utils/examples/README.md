Examples are used to demo how to sign, encrypt and pack the binaries:

 - flash-all-app - pack all binaries into all-app.bin, flashing all binaries into flash in one single command.
 - sign-hash - same as flash-all-app example except that the sign-hash example only accept hash value on the sign server.
